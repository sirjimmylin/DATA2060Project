# DATA 2060 Project: Gaussian Naive Bayes
## Project Overview

This machine learning project is a group project for the class DATA 2060: Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms. In this project, our group recreated from scratch a custom implementation of the Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) algorithm. 



[Scikit-Learn's Implementation](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/1eb422d6c5/sklearn/naive_bayes.py#L151)








### Python and Package Versions
For this project, we used the following Python and package versions: 

| Package    | Version |
|------------|---------|
| Python     | 3.12.11 |
| matplotlib | 3.10.5  |
| numpy      | 2.3.2   |
| sklearn    | 1.7.1   |
| pandas     | 2.3.2   |
| pytest     | 8.4.1   |
| torch      | 2.7.1   |
